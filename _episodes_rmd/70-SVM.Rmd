# Wisconsin Diagnositc Breast Cancer Dataset

![An example of a Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy](742_FNA1.jpg)

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. 

## Attribute Information:

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus, each has 
- a *mean* across cells 
- a *standard deviation* across cells and 
- the *worst* value across cells:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

```{r loadData}
wdbcn<-fread(here::here("data/breast-cancer-wisconsin.csv"))
wdbc<-copy(wdbcn)
names(wdbc)

wdbc$diagnosis<-factor(wdbc$diagnosis)

anyNA(wdbc)

summary(wdbc)
```

# Plot some things:

```{r}
ggplot(wdbc,
       aes(x = radius_mean,
           y = concavity_mean,
           color = diagnosis))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)



#GGally::ggpairs(wdbc,mapping = ggplot2::aes(color = diagnosis))
wdbcn$diagnosis<-recode(wdbcn$diagnosis, "M"=1, "B"=-1)


M<-cor(wdbcn[, -c("id")])
cp<-corrplot(M, order = "hclust",tl.col = "black")
dc <- which(colnames(cp)=="diagnosis") #column  of diagnosis
tc <- dim(M)[1] #total columns
dr <- tc-dc+1 #row of diagnosis, counting from the bottoem of the corrplot
segments(c(-0.5,0.5)+dc, rep(0.5,2), c(-0.5,0.5)+dc, rep(tc+0.5,2), lwd=1) #vertical
segments(rep(0.5,2), c(-0.5,0.5)+dr, rep(tc+0.5,2), c(-0.5,0.5)+dr, lwd=1) #horizontal
```


# Aim

To create a classifier for predicting whether a breast cancer patient's tumor is malignant or benign.

### Train Test Split

```{r test_train_split}
set.seed(3033)
intrain <- createDataPartition(y = wdbc$diagnosis, p= 0.7, list = FALSE)
training <- wdbc[intrain,]
testing <- wdbc[-intrain,]
```

### Some standard checks on the data
```{r standard_checks}
dim(training)
dim(testing)
```

```{r}
set.seed(3233)
