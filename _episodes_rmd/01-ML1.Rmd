## Overview of the course

This workshop is designed to provide and introduction to practical machine learning with R.

The attendees are expected to have some R background (at least at the level of the ["Introductory R" Intersect courses](https://intersect.org.au/training/course/r203/), especially the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) suite of packages and the use of R as a data processing tool.

The workshop will include a lot of live coding and hands-on "experimenting" with R code, and not a lot of detail about the underlying mathematical and computational details of the algorithms used  - we suggest that when you want to try applying one of these algorithms to your own work, you review its underlying assumption in one of the recommended reference books.

We will provide an introduction to some basic principles of machine learning experimentation, describing how one selects a model to use, the concepts of cross-validation. We will demonstrate how these apply to several classical machine learning approaches in R, including supervised (classification and regression, such as K-nearest neighbour and linear regression) and unsupervised (clustering, such as hierarchical and k-means clustering, and dimensionality reduction, such as principal component analysis) methods.


We hope that at the end of the course, learners are able to assess whether any of these approaches are applicable to their own analysis problems, to apply the demonstrated methods to their own datasets (if they're appropriate), and to evaluate whether the models are a good fit for their data. Furthermore, we hope learners become more confident in discovering and trying out new methods of interest that they come across in the literature. 




## Why use R for machine learning?

R is one of the leading languages for data science. Originally developed to carry out statistical analysis, it has a strong suite of tools for preprocessing, exploring and visualising data. A large number of academic researchers, working at the cutting edge of statistical and machine learning methods development, use R to create packages that implement the methods they describe. 

R's primary competitor in the ML space is python, which has the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) library and other libraries. However, scikit-learn is substantially more challenging to add new functionality to, and may not have all of the statistical features required/expected (confidence intervals) implemented. 


## Types of Machine learning

1. **Supervised learning**:
  - The dataset contains a series of inputs, based on which we are trying to predict a predifined outcome, which we know for the original data in the dataset. The outcome can be numerical (in which case the problem is called regression) or categorical (classification).
2. **Unsupervised learning**:
  - No labels are provided, and the algorithm tries to find structure in unlabelled data. Finding groups of similar users (think Netflix) is a classic example of this. 
3. **Semi-supervised learning**:
  - A combination of the two approaches, where we try to use labels from the data to influence the unlabelled data to identify and annotate new classes in the dataset (aka novelty detection). Example: image clustering + manual annotation of clusters.
4. **Reinforcement learning**:
  - The learning algorithm performs a task and gets feedback in real time from operating in a real or simulated environment. Examples are elevator scheduling or learning to play a game.
