The Curse of Dimensionality 
- Ridge Regression 
- Lasso Regression 
- Cross-Validation 
- Bias/Variance Tradeoff



```{r}
# 1. stratified sampling with the rsample package
set.seed(123)
split  <- initial_split(ames, prop = 0.7, strata = "Sale_Price")
ames_train  <- training(split)
ames_test   <- testing(split)
# 2. create a resampling method
cv <- trainControl(
  method = "repeatedcv", 
  number = 10, 
  repeats = 5
  )
# 3. create a hyperparameter grid search
hyper_grid <- expand.grid(k = seq(2, 26, by = 2))
# 4. execute grid search with knn model
#    use RMSE as preferred metric
knn_fit <- train(
  Sale_Price ~ ., 
  data = ames_train, 
  method = "knn", 
  trControl = cv, 
  tuneGrid = hyper_grid,

# 5. evaluate results
# print model results
